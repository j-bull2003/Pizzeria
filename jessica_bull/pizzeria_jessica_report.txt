The first step in the code is to read in the input from the user. 
The input consists of two integers, n and m, on the first line. 

-The integer n represents the dimensions of the city, which is a square grid of size n x n. 
-The integer m represents the number of pizzerias in the city. The next m lines contain information about each pizzeria, given by three integers x, y, and r. 
-The integers x and y represent the location of the pizzeria in the city, where (x, y) is the block in the grid that the pizzeria is located at. 
-The integer r represents the maximum distance that the pizzeria's delivery guy will travel to deliver pizza. 

This information is stored in a list called pizzerias, where each element of the list is a tuple (x, y, r) containing the information about a single pizzeria.

The next step is to initialize a 2D list called delivery_counts, where each element delivery_counts[i][j] represents the number of pizzerias that deliver to block (i, j). 
This list is initialized to all 0s.

Next, the code iterates through each pizzeria (x, y, r) in pizzerias. For each pizzeria, it initializes a visited list to keep track of which blocks have been visited during the breadth-first search. 
It also initializes a queue with the initial block (x, y, 0), where 0 represents the distance from the pizzeria's location. 
Then, the following steps are repeated until the queue is empty:

-Pop the first element (i, j, d) from the queue.
-If the distance d is greater than the delivery range r, or if the block (i, j) has already been visited, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
-Mark the block (i, j) as visited.
-Increment the delivery count for the block (i, j) by 1.
-For each of the four adjacent blocks (i + dx, j + dy), where dx and dy are either 0 or 1, append the block to the queue if it is within the city bounds (i.e., 0 <= i + dx < n and 0 <= j + dy < n) and has not been visited.
-After all pizzerias have been processed, the code finds the maximum delivery count by initializing a variable called max_count to 0 and then comparing the delivery count for each block (i, j) to max_count. 

If delivery_counts[i][j] is greater than max_count, max_count is updated to be equal to delivery_counts[i][j].

Lastly, the code prints the maximum delivery count, which is the maximum number of pizzerias that deliver to a single block in the city.
